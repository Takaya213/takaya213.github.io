Version 2.0 Released!
====================
The initial release of ChatterBot included 7 different code components which made it hard to create your own component based off the main chat window. In Version 2.0 that has been fixed! Now there's one single source of code so you can easily copy and paste the code for your own editing.


Overview
-------------
Drag and drop in the `ChatterBot` component into your designs to create a functioning, customize-able chat bot.

In version 2.0, you can attach a `.json` file within the properties panel to control which `keywords` will trigger the bot to respond. By default the bot is setup to respond to the word `weather`.

To add you're own `.json` data to the component, format it as shown below.

    {
      "messages" : [
        {
          "sender" : "bot",
          "message" : "How are you?",
          "stamp" : "12:20 PM"
        }
      ],
      "keywords" : [
        {
          "phrase" : "food",
          "returnMessage" : "What type of food are you looking for?"
        }
      ]
    }

The objects listed in the `messages` array will show on the component before its been interacted with. Make sure to specify a `sender` (which excepts either `bot` or `user`), a `message` and a `stamp` (the stamp is auto generated for the messages typed into the chat bot).

The objects listed in the `keywords` tell the bot which `phrase` to watch for and if it reads the `phrase` it will send the `returnMessage`. Both the `phrase` and `returnMessage` must be included, otherwise you'll get an error in the console.
